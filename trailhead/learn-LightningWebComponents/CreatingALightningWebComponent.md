# Create a Lightning Web Component

## Create a Lightning Web Component
The basic foundation for interacting with an org using Salesforce CLI is a Salesforce DX project.
A project consists of several local configuration files, as well as the code you want to deploy.
In Salesforce terms we call this code metadata, which is the foundation of the Salesforce Platform. If you're new to Salesforce, check out [Developer Beginner](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/trails/force_com_dev_beginner) trail to learn more about our metadata-driven approach.
