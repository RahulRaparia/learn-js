# learn-js
This repo is for documenting the learning journey for Javascript specifically for the Javascript Developer I Certification Exam and Getting the Lighting Web Component Specialist Super Badge. 
Even though this journey is a little coupled with the SFCC environment, but the Javascript Source Code  can be used as a reference for any other Component Based JS Development(maybe).
